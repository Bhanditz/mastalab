CONTRIBUTING
============

### Localizations:

Mastalab works only with [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/mastalab), which offers nice tools for helping in translations.
New translations will be automatically merged in a branch.
If your language is not listed, please ask me to add it. If you prefer to work on an XML file, you should be able [to upload it with Crowdin](https://support.crowdin.com/xml-configuration/).
Crowdin will not pick up changes in develop branch, that's why all translations should be done with this tool.
